## Email #1: The Problem Hook (Day 1)

**Subject Lines (A/B Test):**
- A: "Your 3D printing brand is missing 180% more revenue"
- B: "Why Canadian buyers abandon 65% more carts than US buyers"
- C: "The hidden cost killing your North American expansion"

**Email Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company Name] creates incredible [product type] - your [specific product mention] caught my attention on [platform/source].

Quick question: Have you tried selling into Canada or the US market yet?

Most international 3D printing brands I talk to hit the same wall:
- Shipping costs that make buyers abandon their carts
- Complex customs and duty calculations
- 3-4 week delivery times that kill conversion rates

The data is brutal: Canadian conversion rates for international sellers average 1.65% vs 4.62% for domestic sellers. That's 180% more revenue left on the table.

But here's what's interesting...

There's a counterintuitive approach that a few smart brands are using to flip this entirely. They're actually converting Canadian buyers at US rates (or better) while eliminating shipping headaches completely.

Would you be open to a 10-minute conversation about how this works?

Best,
[Your Name]
Assembly Studio

P.S. - If this resonates, I'd love to show you the case study of how [European Brand] went from $0 to $50K/month in Canadian sales using this system.

## Email #2: The Solution Tease (Day 4)

**Subject:** "The counterintuitive Canada approach [Company Name]"

Hi [First Name],

I shared some rough conversion data earlier about Canadian vs US buyers for international brands.

You might be wondering: "What's this counterintuitive approach you mentioned?"

Here's the thing most people get wrong about selling into Canada:

Everyone tries to ship directly from [their country] → Canada. 

The shipping costs, customs delays, and buyer uncertainty kill deals before they start.

The counterintuitive approach? 

Stop shipping to Canada entirely.

Instead, manufacture IN Canada and ship locally. Suddenly:
✓ 2-day domestic shipping (like Amazon)
✓ No customs or duties for buyers
✓ Local phone numbers and addresses build trust
✓ Same-day customer service in their timezone

We've helped [X] international brands implement this system. Average result: 3.2x conversion rate increase in first 90 days.

The best part? Your first 5 orders ship completely free as we prove this works for your brand.

Interested in seeing how this would work for [Company Name] specifically?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Email #3: Social Proof + Case Study (Day 7)

**Subject:** "How [Similar Brand] added $43K/month with this system"

[First Name],

Remember I mentioned how a few smart brands are using a counterintuitive approach to crack the Canadian market?

Here's exactly how [Similar Brand from Their Region] did it:

**Before:**
- Shipping to Canada: $27-45 per order
- Conversion rate: 1.2%
- Monthly Canadian revenue: $3,400
- Customer complaints about delivery times: 23%

**After (90 days with our system):**
- Local Canadian shipping: $8-12 per order  
- Conversion rate: 4.1%
- Monthly Canadian revenue: $43,200
- Customer complaints: 2%

The secret? They stopped trying to ship internationally and started manufacturing locally through our Canadian production network.

**Here's the exact process:**
1. They send us their product files and specifications
2. We produce initial inventory at our Toronto facility
3. Orders flow directly to local fulfillment (2-day shipping)
4. They scale based on demand without any upfront investment

Their founder told me: "We spent 8 months trying to figure out Canadian logistics. This solved it in 8 days."

Want to see how this would work for [Company Name]?

I can show you:
- Projected conversion rates for your product category
- Exact cost breakdown (manufacturing + fulfillment)
- Timeline to launch in Canadian market

Plus, your first 5 orders ship free while we prove the system works.

Worth a 15-minute call?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Email #4: Urgency + Final Offer (Day 10)

**Subject:** "Final call: First 5 orders free for [Company Name]"

[First Name],

I've reached out a few times about helping [Company Name] crack the Canadian market using our local manufacturing approach.

I realize you might be swamped (or this might not be a priority right now).

But here's the thing - I'm only extending the "First 5 Orders Ship Free" offer to 12 international brands this quarter, and I'm down to the last 3 spots.

Why the limit? 

Each new brand requires dedicated onboarding, quality testing, and fulfillment setup. We can only do this well for a small number of partners at a time.

**What you get:**
✓ Complete Canadian market entry strategy
✓ Local manufacturing and fulfillment setup
✓ First 5 orders ship completely free
✓ Real data on Canadian conversion rates for your products
✓ Zero upfront investment or commitment

**What I need:**
- 15-minute call to understand your products and goals
- Your top 3 SKUs for initial testing
- Commitment to evaluate the results honestly

If this isn't the right time, no worries - just let me know and I'll circle back in Q2.

But if you're serious about Canadian expansion, let's talk this week.

P.S. - The last brand that said "let me think about it" came back 2 months later asking if the offer was still available. It wasn't. Don't be that brand.

## European Market Version (Email #1)

**Subject:** "Why US tariffs are killing your American expansion"

Hi [First Name],

Saw [Company Name]'s [product] on [platform] - impressive work on the [specific feature].

Quick question: How's your US market expansion going?

I ask because every European 3D printing brand I talk to hits the same brutal reality:
- New tariffs adding 15-25% to product costs
- Constantly shifting customs regulations
- 3-week shipping times that kill urgency
- US buyers who abandon carts when they see international shipping

But here's what's counterintuitive...

The smartest European brands aren't fighting the US market directly anymore. They're using Canada as their North American gateway instead.

Same time zone advantage. Similar buying behavior. Zero tariffs on most 3D printed goods. And 2-day shipping to 90% of North American buyers.

[European Brand] went from $0 to $67K/month using this approach.

Curious how this works?

Best,
[Your Name]
